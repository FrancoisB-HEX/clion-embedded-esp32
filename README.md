<!-- Plugin description -->
This project is a modified version of Elmot's excellent <a href="https://github.com/elmot/clion-embedded-arm">OpenOCD +
STM / ARM CLion plugin</a> modified to work with the ESP32 series of MCU. All thanks go to them!

This is a plugin to support complete ESP32 development from within CLion.

If there are any features missing, anything that you'd like to see, or of course bugs, please raise an issue and I'll
try and have a look at it.
